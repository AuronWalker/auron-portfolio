      "fullDescription": "Map Maker is a small software project for quickly designing and prototyping map ideas. This project is packed with interesting features such as different-sized maps, Biomes and the ability to save maps. I learnt so much about the process of developing software with it being my first attempt at making an app. While I never realeased it I am still very proud of the project. Built with <a class='in-text-link' href='https://www.electronjs.org/'>Electron<a/> using <a class='in-text-link' href='https://www.javascript.com/'>Javascript<a/>"

      "fullDescription": "A collection of visual prototypes where the key focus was recreating an interesting algorithm rather than a full project. These are some of my favourite projects as I get to focus and understand something specific that is visually cool to look at. Once I have made something that looks impressive I leave the prototype there to come back to if I need to recreate something for a full project later on.",
