This project is packed with interesting features such as different-sized maps, Biomes and the ability to save maps. I learnt so much about the process of developing software with it being my first attempt at making an app. While I never realeased it I am still very proud of the project.

export const prototypesFullDescription = "A collection of visual prototypes where the key focus was recreating an interesting algorithm rather than a full project. These are some of my favourite projects as I get to focus and understand something specific that is visually cool to look at. Once I have made something that looks impressive I leave the prototype there to come back to if I need to recreate something for a full project later on. I have quite a few of these prototypes but these are my favourite. ";
